Investing & trading in 2025: Better use this set of non-Nifty50 stocks to take care of the investor and trader in you,"Dec 22, 2024, 03:19:00 PM IST",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/investing-trading-in-2025-better-use-this-set-of-non-nifty50-stocks-to-take-care-of-the-investor-and-trader-in-you/articleshow/116563733.cms,"Volatility is not bad, if one is able to learn from it. The hard fact, however, is that most of us don't want to learn from the market, only earn from it. Trading and investing diverge significantly across skill requirements, capital needs, and the potential returns they offer. This distinction is widely recognized by the world's foremost wealth generators, who typically specialize in one approach over the other. Yet, many of us harbor the ambition of engaging in both trading and investing concurrently. Combining these activities can often lead to negligible or less-than-optimal returns. In the stock market, while no outcome is guaranteed, there exists a selection of stocks that stands a better chance of benefiting those who wish to wear both the trader's and investor's hats simultaneously. But then, like everything in the market, this too comes with caveats. Gift A Story Share member-only stories with your friends or family and help them read it for free. Gifting Limit Reached!

Or, to put it another way, a multi-bagger stock. The reality, however, is that in a market that has been on a bull run for 10 years and valuations are high, the probability of finding stocks that deliver extraordinary returns is low. In order to get such returns, you will have to take risks. But do remember that there are different kinds of risks. Buying a penny stock is a risk. Buying a stock from a sector which is currently in bad shape is also a risk. The latter, however, is a logical risk and the probability that you will earn good returns is higher compared to picking up a penny stock. So, as we are about to kickstart 2025, here is a set of stocks which we believe are for long-term investors who are willing to take risk, but with knowledge of the kind of risk they are taking.

The 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex finished at 78,041.59, declining by 1176.46 points or 1.49% while the Nifty50 settled at 23,587.50, falling by 364.20 points or 1.52%.  Nifty's initial rebound proved fleeting as sellers regained control, leading to the unwinding of positions by buyers and this selling pressure drove the index below the 200-day EMA, Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at SAMCO Securities said, adding that this trend underscores the prevailing bearish sentiment in the market.""On the daily chart, the index hovers near a crucial support level at 23,500, aligning with an upward-sloping trendline. A decisive breach below this support could trigger intensified selling pressure. Conversely, any recovery attempt is likely to face resistance around 24,000, a level marked by an unfilled gap that reflects weak buying interest at higher levels. The RSI on the daily chart has slipped below 40, signalling waning buying momentum,"" Dhameja said. Here are 5 stock recommendations for Monday: Target Price: Rs 1,425Stop Loss: Rs 1,275The successful closing at record high on weekly scale, supported by a bullish alignment of moving averages and a rising RSI, signals a likely continuation of the uptrend in the coming sessions.

Asian paints: Is hyper competition priced in?

A number of large industrial houses announced their entry into the paint industry. From the JSW group to JK Cement, and Grasim to Pidilite, all of them entered a sector which had for long been dominated by the likes of Asian Paints. Now combine this with the fact that the Asian Paints stock, one of the biggest wealth creators on the market, has been underperforming for the last four years. Has the market priced in all the competition? Or is the sector likely to see a longer phase of competition in real business and underperformance on the street? The street has also become extremely sensitive to what happens in the company. The exit of two senior executives saw the stock slip sharply. Will the valuation matrix of the paint sector, and Asian Paints in particular, change for the better? The answer is not in black and white.

Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India Invest Now Powered By This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Invest Now The market has seen a downward trend throughout last week, falling 1.5 percent on December 20 and losing 4.8 percent for the week. Sentiment turned significantly bearish, with the Nifty 50 falling below the 200-day EMA (23,700) on a closing basis, accompanied by a negative bias in momentum indicators. Hence, if the index sustains below 23,700, the November low (23,263) cannot be ruled out in the upcoming sessions. However, in the event of a bounce-back, the first hurdle is expected to be at 23,900, followed by 24,065, which is seen as a key resistance zone, according to experts.  Here are 15 data points we have collated to help you spot profitable trades: 1)Key Levels For TheNifty 50(23,588) Resistance based on pivot points: 23,932, 24,057, and 24,259 Support based on pivot points: 23,528, 23,404, and 23,202 Special Formation: The Nifty 50 formed a long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with above-average volumes. Following Friday’s fall, the index is now trading below all key moving averages, with the 200-day EMA being the last one broken on Friday. Furthermore, the index is trading below the lower band of the Bollinger Bands, while the momentum indicators—RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 34 and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) dropping below the zero line with a negative crossover—are all signaling weakness. 2)Key Levels For TheBank Nifty(50,759) Resistance based on pivot points: 51,389, 51,629, and 52,019 Support based on pivot points: 50,610, 50,369, and 49,980 Resistance based on Fibonacci retracement: 51,580, 52,131 Support based on Fibonacci retracement: 50,664, 49,787 Special Formation: The Bank Nifty also corrected throughout the week, forming a large bearish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with lower highs and lower lows for the fourth consecutive session. The banking index is also trading below the lower band of the Bollinger Bands and is 324 points away from the 200-day EMA (50,435), while it is already below the 10, 20, 50, and 100-day EMAs. The RSI has dropped to 35, and the MACD is near the zero line with a negative bias. All of these indicators point to weakness. The index fell 1.6 percent on Friday, with above-average volumes, and lost 5.3 percent for the week.  3)Nifty Call Options Data According to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 24,000 strike (with 92.14 lakh contracts). This level can act as a key resistance level for the Nifty in the short term. It was followed by the 24,500 strike (84.97 lakh contracts), and the 24,700 strike (58.25 lakh contracts). Maximum Call writing was observed at the 24,000 strike, which saw an addition of 28.93 lakh contracts, followed by the 23,900 and 24,200 strikes, which added 25.94 lakh and 23.02 lakh contracts, respectively, while the maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 24,300 strike, which shed 1.77 lakh contracts, followed by the 22,500, which shed 23,950 contracts.  4)Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the 23,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 82.1 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the Nifty. It was followed by the 23,500 strike (66.7 lakh contracts), and the 24,000 strike (55.93 lakh contracts). The maximum Put writing was placed at the 23,200 strike, which saw an addition of 21.9 lakh contracts, followed by the 22,500, and 22,800 strikes, with 12.31 lakh, and 6.43 lakh contracts added, respectively, while the maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 24,000 strike, which shed 26.53 lakh contracts, followed by the 24,500 and 24,200 strikes, which shed 6.87 lakh and 5.1 lakh contracts, respectively.  5)Bank Nifty Call Options Data According to the monthly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 53,000 strike, with 31.49 lakh contracts. This can act as a key resistance level for the index in the short term. It was followed by the 52,500 strike (26.71 lakh contracts) and the 52,000 strike (21.95 lakh contracts). Maximum Call writing was visible at the 52,000 strike (with the addition of 7.79 lakh contracts), followed by the 51,000 strike (7.46 lakh contracts) and the 51,500 strike (6.61 lakh contracts), while the maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 52,700 strike, which shed 39,285 contracts, followed by the 52,600 and 48,500 strikes, which shed 14,325 and 7,950 contracts, respectively.  6)Bank Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the 49,000 strike holds the maximum open interest (with 16.5 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index. This was followed by the 50,000 strike (15.28 lakh contracts) and the 51,000 strike (10.32 lakh contracts). The maximum Put writing was observed at the 50,800 strike (which added 3.07 lakh contracts), followed by the 50,700 strike (1.59 lakh contracts) and the 48,500 strike (1.38 lakh contracts), while the maximum Put unwinding was seen at the 51,000 strike, which shed 3.03 lakh contracts, followed by the 52,000 and 51,500 strikes, which shed 2.82 lakh and 2.65 lakh contracts, respectively.  7)Funds Flow (Rs crore)  8)Put-Call Ratio The Nifty Put-Call ratio (PCR), which indicates the mood of the market, dropped to 0.8 on December 20, from 0.91 level in the previous session. The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9)India VIX The India VIX, the volatility index, jumped to 15.07 on Friday, up 3.88 percent from the previous level of 14.51, which adds further discomfort for bulls. For bulls to regain a sense of comfort, the fear index would need to fall to around the 12-13 zone.  10)Long Build-up (2 Stocks) A long build-up was seen in 2 stocks. An increase in open interest (OI) and price indicates a build-up of long positions.  11)Long Unwinding (116 Stocks) 116 stocks saw a decline in open interest (OI) along with a fall in price, indicating long unwinding.  12)Short Build-up (106 Stocks) 106 stocks saw an increase in OI along with a fall in price, indicating a build-up of short positions.  13)Short-Covering (3 Stocks) 3 stocks saw short-covering, meaning a decrease in OI, along with a price increase.  14)High Delivery Trades Here are the stocks that saw a high share of delivery trades. A high share of delivery reflects investing (as opposed to trading) interest in a stock.  15)Stocks Under F&O Ban Securities banned under the F&O segment include companies where derivative contracts cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit. Stocks added to F&O ban: RBL Bank Stocks retained in F&O ban: Bandhan Bank, Granules India, Hindustan Copper, Manappuram Finance, SAIL Stocks removed from F&O ban: NMDC, PVR INOX Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"Plastic sector shines in the tough times, check these 2 stocks",No date,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/plastic-sector-shines-in-the-tough-times-check-these-2-stocks-12895278.html,"My Account Follow us on: Powered By See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Powered By India's Largest Regional Retail Option Traders Summit. (BOTS) is a prestigious options trading event organized by Traders Gurukul. Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India Invest Now Powered By This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Invest Now It was the bear's week on D-Street as the Nifty50 lost 4.77% and closed at 23,587. The index had recently sparked hopes of a bullish rally after bouncing from 23,700 to 24,800, but last week (ending December 20), fear again gripped the markets. The sentiment has shifted as the Nifty50 slipped below its crucial 200-day exponential moving average (200DEMA) of 23,691, inclining towards the bears. In times of volatility, the broader market might seem bleak, but certain sectors still display growth potential. Among these, midcaps and smallcaps show signs of strength, particularly with the Nifty Midcap150 and Nifty SMLCAP250 trending by 4% and 5%, respectively, above their respective 200DEMA levels. This suggests that readers should shift their focus from largecap stocks to those in midcap and smallcap segments for stock-specific opportunities. To make informed decisions in such a market scenario, we turned to check the sectors that are outperforming the broader market index. We ran the Smart Relative Strength (RS) scanner by Definedge to find these. The sectors with the highest positive scores from the scanner were found to be the textile and plastic sectors. While we discussed the textile sector in last week’s article, this week, we focus on the plastic sector, which shows strong potential for continued growth. The Definedge Plastic EQW Index The Definedge Plastic Index is an equal-weighted index comprising 35 stocks related to plastics. It represents a broad spectrum of companies in the plastics sector and offers a balanced view of its overall performance. Definedge Plastic, Monthly ChartThe Definedge Plastic Index has been trending upward monthly, signalling a bullish primary trend. Whenever the index breaks past previous highs, it has historically led to further rallies, and right now, it has breached a previous high, retested it, and is poised for a northward journey. With the broader market uncertain, the plastic sector stands out. It is trending near its all-time high and showing strong technical indicators for the weeks ahead. Stock in Focus Among the top performers in the Definedge Plastic sector, Emmbi Industries has stood out.  Emmbi Industries Emmbi Industries specialises in manufacturing various plastic products, including flexible packaging materials.  On the 1% X 3 Daily Point & Figure (P&F) chart, the stock initially broke out at Rs 130, and after a retest, a follow-up breakout occurred at Rs 157. This indicates strong demand for the stock, which closed 2.5% higher last week (ending December 20), even as the broader market saw significant losses. This is the first stock the readers can potentially add to their buying watchlist. Kingfa Science & Technology India Another stock making waves in the Definedge Plastic Index is Kingfa Science & Technology India. This leading player in the plastic industry is known for producing high-performance plastic compounds and alloys used in a wide range of applications, including automotive, electronics, and consumer goods.  The stock has recently broken out from a falling trendline, as evidenced by the 1% X 3 Daily P&F chart, signalling a potential resumption of its bullish momentum. Furthermore, the breakout from a Double Top Buy (DTB) pattern on the P&F chart reinforces the bullish setup, suggesting that the stock may potentially continue its upward trajectory in the coming weeks. To conclude, the plastic sector has shown strong relative strength, and stocks like Emmbi Industries and Kingfa Science & Technology India stand out for their technical strength and growth potential.

"Dalal Street Week Ahead: Global Trends, FII Flow, Rupee among 10 key factors to watch next week",No date,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dalal-street-week-ahead-global-trends-fii-flow-rupee-among-10-key-factors-to-watch-next-week-12895437.html,"My Account Follow us on: Powered By See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Powered By India's Largest Regional Retail Option Traders Summit. (BOTS) is a prestigious options trading event organized by Traders Gurukul. Held on the 2nd OR 3rd Sunday of every month, across top cities in India Invest Now Powered By This functionality will provide users with ease of access navigation and enable create a new revenue line by generating leads of potential customers for brokers in a more integrated manner. Invest Now The market recorded the biggest weekly loss since June 2022, falling 4.77 percent for the week ended December 20, tracking weakness in the global counterparts especially after the US Federal Reserve sees only two rate cuts in 2025 (instead of an earlier forecast of four) as officials expect a higher inflation outlook. Higher bond yields, a stronger US dollar, the rupee breaching 85 mark, and FII outflow also caused selling pressure in the benchmark markets. After the severe correction, the market is expected to consolidate with a negative bias and keep an eye on the trend in global peers and FII flow in the coming holiday-shortened week. Experts said the trading volume is likely to be low, given the year-end and Christmas holiday season in major parts of the world. The BSE Sensex plunged 4,092 points (5 percent) to close at 78,042, and the Nifty 50 tanked 1,181 points (4.8 percent) to 23,588. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down by 3.53 percent and 3.57 percent, respectively, during the week. Selling pressure was also seen across sectors, barring pharma. Looking ahead, Siddhartha Khemka, Head—Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said, ""Indian markets are expected to remain subdued and will closely follow global cues amidst a volatile environment."" With the festive season approaching and global markets closed for 2-3 days, including a domestic holiday on December 25, market activity is expected to be low next week, according to him. The market will remain shut on December 25 for the Christmas holiday. Here are 10 key factors to watch next week: Global Economic Data Globally investors will keep an eye on monthly durable goods orders, new home sales, and weekly jobs data from the US, while the United Kingdom will disclose its GDP and current account numbers for the September quarter. Furthermore, minutes of the recent monetary policy by Bank of Japan, unemployment rate, retail sales, and construction orders from Japan will also be monitored.  Domestic Economic Data On the domestic front, there won't be any major trigger in terms of data barring foreign exchange reserves for the week ended December 20 which will be released on December 27. Forex reserves have been declining since the last week of September, down by nearly $2 billion to $652.87 billion (the lowest level of nearly six months) in the week ended December 13, while it was down by $52 billion from its record high of $704.89 billion on September 27. FII Flow The market participants will also focus on the activity at the FIIs' and DIIs' desks, though there will be a bit of a decline in volume due to year-end and the Christmas holiday season for a couple of weeks globally. Last week, there was been change in the strategy by foreign institutional investors from buying to selling due to rising US dollar and bond yields (post Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook) which weighed on the market sentiment. FIIs net sold Rs 15,828 crore worth of shares last week, which resulted in turning net sellers for the month as well (-Rs 4,121 crore) in the cash segment, but domestic institutional investors managed to offset some FIIs outflow, buying Rs 11,874 crore during the week, taking the total net purchases to Rs 16,547 crore for the current month. Meanwhile, the US 10-year treasury yield spiked to 4.53 percent following the recent Federal Reserve commentary, up by 3.02 percent from 4.397 percent the previous week, extending the uptrend for another week. The rally was also seen in the US Dollar index (DXY), rising 0.81 percent during the week to 107.815, the highest closing level since November 2022, continuing upward trend for the third consecutive session. Indian Rupee The focus will also be on the Indian rupee. Given the increasing demand for the US dollar supported by the Federal Reserve's outlook and geopolitical tensions, the rupee remained bearish for the seventh consecutive week, breaching 85 a dollar for the first time in history. The currency weakened by 0.2 percent to 84.927 against the US dollar. Experts expect the overall trend to remain bearish amid likely volatility. ""We expect a rupee to remain volatile next week amid volatility in the dollar index and volatility in the domestic equity markets and a pair could trade in the range of 84.50-85.60,"" Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research said. Oil Prices Oil is another factor to watch next week. The subdued oil prices remained supportive for India, the net oil importer. Brent crude futures, the international oil benchmark, were down by 2.08 percent during the week to $72.94 a barrel. The prices remained below all key moving averages, which is a bearish signal. Experts see the weak outlook for 2025 as well and according to them, the spike in prices is possible only if the geopolitical tensions escalate significantly. IPO The primary market will remain active in the coming week as well, with one mainboard and two SME IPOs hitting Dalal Street, while there will be several listings lined up. From the mainboard segment, Unimech Aerospace and Manufacturing will open for subscription on December 23, while Solar91 Cleantech and Anya Polytech & Fertilizers from the SME segment will be launched on December 24 and December 26, respectively. In the mainboard segment, Transrail Lighting, DAM Capital Advisors, Mamata Machinery, Sanathan Textiles, and Concord Enviro Systems will close their public issues on December 23 and debut on the bourses effective December 27. Ventive Hospitality, Senores Pharmaceuticals, and Carraro India are set to close on December 24. In the SME segment. Newmalayalam Steel IPO will be closing on December 23, while investors can start trading in NACDAC Infrastructure, Identical Brains Studios, and Newmalayalam Steel shares effective December 24, 26, and 27, respectively. Technical View Technically, the Nifty 50 is definitely looking weak as it traded below 10-and 20-week Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) as well as in the lower band of Bollinger Bands on the weekly charts. The momentum indicators RSI and MACD also showed negative bias on the daily as well as weekly charts, in fact on the daily scale the RSI reached 34 after failing to hold the 60 mark and the MACD dropped below the zero line, which is a negative sign. Further, the index closed below the 200-day EMA for the first time since November 21. Hence, the next target on the downside is expected to be 23,263, the November low, followed by 23,000, however in case of a rebound, 23,875 is the immediate target, followed by 24,050 on the higher side, experts said. F&O Cues As per the monthly options data, the 24,000 strike holds the maximum Call open interest, followed by the 24,500 and 24,200 strikes, with maximum Call writing at the 24,000 strikes, and then the 23,900 and 24,200 strikes. On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 23,000 strikes, followed by the 23,500 and 24,000 strikes, with maximum writing at the 23,200 strikes, and then the 22,800 and 22,700 strikes. The above options data indicated that the Nifty 50 is likely to be in the range of 23,000-24,000 in the short term as breaking on either side can give clear direction to the market. India VIX The India VIX, the volatility index, jumped 15.48 percent during the week to reach 15.07, which is nearly a month's high, making the trend uncomfortable for bulls. As long as the VIX stays in the higher zone, the bull may be in a weak position.

Invest Now Stock market participants would track global trends and foreign investors' trading activity in a holiday-shortened week ahead, amid lack of any major domestic trigger in sight, analysts said. Equity markets will remain closed on Wednesday for Christmas. ""Looking ahead, no major events are scheduled. However, a few global economic indicators will be pivotal in shaping the market direction, including the US bond yields, dollar index performance, initial jobless claims, new home sales data. ""Amid heightened volatility and persistent FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors) selling pressure, investors are likely to adopt a cautious stance. Despite recent weakness, the market outlook remains cautiously optimistic. However, relentless selling by FIIs has added to market pressure,"" Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst, Swastika Investmart Ltd, said. Last week, the BSE benchmark tanked 4,091.53 points or 4.98 per cent, and the Nifty slumped 1,180.8 points or 4.76 per cent. ""The sudden change in FII strategy from buying to selling has impacted markets,"" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said. The rupee-dollar trend and movement of global oil benchmark Brent crude will also be crucial in dictating the market.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head – Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said, Indian markets are expected to remain subdued and will closely follow global cues amidst a volatile environment.

Invest Now By Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at Samco Securities The Nifty index recorded its steepest weekly decline of 4.77 percent, wiping out the gains accumulated over the previous four weeks. With the index closing below the 200-DEMA and maintaining a lower-high pattern, concerns about a continuation of the downtrend persist in the coming week, further exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions. This significant drop in the previous week has formed a Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. On the daily chart, the index decisively broke below its pivotal 200-day exponential moving average (200-DEMA) while creating a series of lower highs. This sharp downturn signifies a robust return of bearish momentum, as buyers anticipating further upside were trapped. The overall market structure appears to be deteriorating, with diminishing buying interest adding to the bearish narrative. With this move, the Nifty has convincingly breached the psychological support level of 24,000, signaling a notable shift in market sentiment. The 24,800 level now emerges as a formidable resistance zone. The index is currently hovering around its immediate support range of 23,500–23,200, bolstered by the 50-week exponential moving average (50-WEMA), a level that has historically acted as a strong support. On the daily chart, the index has consistently failed to close above its previous highs, indicating persistent selling pressure at elevated levels. Moreover, the Nifty is trading below the key psychological resistance band of 23,800 to 24,000, a level reinforced by heavy call writing activity. This cautious sentiment suggests traders are skeptical about any immediate upside potential. Closing below the 200-DEMA, along with the RSI (Relative Strength Index) dipping below 40, further underscores the bears’ dominance. Open Interest (OI) Trends The week witnessed a significant surge in Nifty futures OI, climbing from 12.60 million shares to 14.62 million shares—an increase of 2.02 million shares. This sharp rise in OI, coupled with the 4.77% drop, signals aggressive short positions by bearish participants, highlighting the strength of negative sentiment in the market. FPI Long-Short Ratio Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have drastically cut their long positions, with the long-short ratio plummeting to 31.20% from 38.69% at the start of the week. This decline reflects waning optimism among institutional players, further solidifying the bearish outlook. Key Weekly Series Levels Weekly options data indicates that the 24,000 strike holds the highest Call open interest, while the 23,000 strike has the largest Put OI. Intense activity in the 23,600–24,000 Call range and 23,500–23,000 Put range highlights immediate resistance at 24,000 and key support at 23,000. Heavy Call writing in the 23,600–24,000 range reinforces the prevailing bearish sentiment. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) has dropped to 0.71, signaling that bears maintain a firm grip on the market. The surge in OI, combined with the index’s steep fall, suggests trapped buyers and sets the stage for a potential slide toward the next support level at 23,200. Outlook for the Upcoming Week The sharp decline from 24,000 has firmly established this level as a critical resistance zone. Immediate support lies between 23,300 and 23,500, reinforced by strong Put writing and the previous swing low. Holding this range will be essential for any meaningful recovery. On the upside, the 23,800–24,000 zone presents a significant barrier, as indicated by the option chain and price action. Sustaining above 24,000 could ignite short-covering rallies, driving the index toward 24,500. The decrease in FPIs’ long positions and the rise in OI during the index’s steep drop confirm bearish sentiment. If the index breaches 23,500, it could trigger accelerated selling as buyers unwind their positions, potentially dragging the index down to the crucial support at 23,000. As long as the Nifty remains below the 23,800–24,000 zone, a ""sell-on-rise"" strategy is expected to dominate, paving the way for continued bearish momentum.

Invest Now Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here Review of the Last Week As far as data-backed forecasting is concerned, it was a disastrous week for us. Monday and Thursday's negative trends were surely expected, but the unexpected negative movements on Wednesday and Friday took us by surprise and momentarily shook our confidence. The harsh truth is that when data indicates extreme optimism, it is time to be cautious. We anticipated wide volatility during the current week, followed by a directional move in the next or the upcoming week. Broad markets crashed, and blue-chip stocks, which had shown signs of bottoming out, hit new lows, significantly impacting the index chart. In the December 17th daily write-up, we anticipated a fall, particularly in FMCG, expecting it to hit new lows. We recommended contrarian investments against the trend or small SIPs, suggesting it was an auspicious day. However, the markets neither stopped nor reversed course. Technical The market is notorious for either offering opportunities or trapping people on the wrong side of a trade. The Friday the 13th candle gave significant hope that the Nifty could trade above 25,000, albeit briefly, providing an exit opportunity for trapped bulls. The directional fall over five days, amounting to 1,180 Nifty points, dashed the hopes of many. While this was technically not surprising, as 24,750 was a very strong supply zone, the aggression shown by sellers has now created fear. We had expected a nominal rise, with the 19th being an auspicious day to short, triggering a sell-off. Our opinion that 22,700 could be breached after January might now happen before the TimeMap projections. Breaking 23,520 could trigger another wave of panic sell-offs, with large account withdrawal applications adding further pressure on the markets. The first sign of strength would only appear above 24,500; otherwise, the theme remains ""sell on rise."" Small-cap and midcap quality stocks with stable performance are being confidently accumulated, suggesting that the years 2026-2027 may see increased merger and acquisition activity in Indian capital markets. Deep-pocketed investors will likely push many small caps into the midcap space. TimeMap We went wrong in our forecast, as our bias was positive, recommending a bullish stance for the week, and we were 100% wrong each day. It is better to take a clear stance, even at the risk of being wrong, than to offer vague, contradictory statements and claim credit regardless of the outcome. Most analysts and chartists prefer giving mixed views, confusing investors. Regardless, we will begin our forecast for next week. The next five days are expected to be positive from Friday's closing points. Against the 1,180-point fall, the recovery range could be a minimum of 40 percent or more. TimeMap focuses on behavioral pattern recognition—it is not about price but emotional and response mapping, which makes reading the masses’ mindset a challenging task. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic about the coming week, focusing on specific counters that closed above their December 5th levels, as they could be the best-performing stocks. FMCG, MNC Pharma, select technology stocks, and potentially textile industry stocks are showing positive signals for the coming days. December 23, 2024: Monday: K-8: Hasta: Auspicious Day TheTithisuggests bottoming out or ending a trend, while the Nakshatra is ideal for slow and steady investments. Patience pays, especially under the influence of Hasta. Investment and BTST (Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow) are recommended. Aggressive yet focused actions could be highly rewarding. Exit BTST positions before 11 am. PSU stocks are expected to attract institutional investment flows. December 24, 2024: Tuesday: K-9: Chitra: Bullish Day - Volatile Day A higher opening is expected. Market sentiment may appear confused, with fear and overcautious behaviour influencing volumes in the first 30 minutes.Navamifavours a bullish first half and a bearish second half. Do not be surprised to see a gap-up opening and many counters hitting new highs. December 25, 2024: Wednesday: K-10: Swati: Volatile Swatiis considered the best investmentNakshatra, andTithi 10is ideal for momentum stocks with a 6 to 8-month view. A negative closing would be a very positive sign for the markets. Insurance, oil refineries, and cement companies are likely to perform well, while midcap stocks could be under pressure. Contrarian investments in oversold stocks are highly recommended. Jupiter's alignment with Saturn (90 degrees) shows positive indications for the markets, potentially leading to an announcement or global event that activates significant fund participation. December 26, 2024: Thursday: K-11: Vishakha: Auspicious Day Historically,Tithi 11has favoured short sellers. Despite an enthusiastic opening, markets tend to decline slowly and steadily by the end of the day. Coupled with Swati, this presents a good opportunity to average stocks showing fresh buying signals on the chart. December 27, 2024: Friday: K-12: Anuradha: Bad Day - Good for Swing Trades A higher opening is expected. TheTithisupports proactive action and conviction in trades. TheNakshatrafavours failure patterns on both short and long sides, offering excellent opportunities on hourly charts. This day could be the most profitable of the week for traders.Let me know if you need any further refinements.

"Chartist Talks: SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah expects Nifty, Bank Nifty to break November low next week, cautious on Siemens",No date,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talks-sbi-securities-sudeep-shah-expects-nifty-bank-nifty-to-break-november-low-next-week-advises-avoiding-siemens-12895183.html,"My Account Follow us on: Powered By See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Powered By India's Largest Regional Retail Option Traders Summit.

Invest Now According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, technical indicators point to strong bearish momentum in the Nifty 50. The index is likely to test its prior swing low of 23,263 level (November low), followed by 23,000 levels in the short term, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol. Currently, 90 percent of Nifty constituents are trading below their 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), while 88 percent are trading below their 50-day EMA, reflecting significantly weakened internal market strength, he believes. Even, the Bank Nifty is also likely to achieve 100% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent upward rally, he said. After significant selling pressure in Siemens, he recommends exiting as well as staying away from Siemens for the next couple of months. ""On a weekly scale, the stock has formed a Triple Top pattern, and it is about to slip below its neckline,"" said the Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities with over 17 years of experience. Are the charts signaling that the Nifty 50 can break the November low next week, though the volume is expected to be lower given the holiday season for FIIs? What do you advise in terms of strategy in such conditions? After the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement on Wednesday, global indices witnessed a sharp decline. The sell-off was triggered by the Fed's decision to lower interest rates by a quarter point, as anticipated, but its projection of fewer rate cuts next year than previously estimated dampened investor sentiment. Our benchmark index, Nifty, has tumbled nearly 5 percent, marking its steepest weekly fall since June 2022. This decline has wiped out the gains of the past four weeks. Adding to the bearish sentiment, Nifty has slipped below its short and long-term moving averages. Most notably, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) failed to cross the 60 mark and subsequently dropped below 40, signaling a bearish shift in momentum as per RSI range shift rules. Additionally, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) line has crossed below the signal line, turning the histogram negative and reinforcing the bearish outlook. Currently, 90 percent of Nifty constituents are trading below their 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), while 88 percent are trading below their 50-day EMA, reflecting significantly weakened internal market strength. These technical indicators collectively point to strong bearish momentum in the index. Talking about crucial levels, the index is likely to test its prior swing low of 23,263 level, followed by 23,000 levels in the short term, while resistance has shifted lower to the 23,950-24,000 zone for the short term. Will the Bank Nifty achieve a 100% Fibonacci retracement (from November low to December high) next week? Yes, it is likely to achieve the 100% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent upward rally. The banking benchmark index Bank Nifty has strongly underperformed frontline indices as it has tumbled by 5.27 percent. This was the steepest decline since February 2022. On a weekly scale, it has formed a sizeable bearish candle. Along with this fall, the index has slipped below its 20, 50, and 100-day EMA level. The daily RSI has also slipped below the 40 mark, and it is in a falling mode. These technical factors indicate further bearish momentum in the index. Talking about levels, the 200-day EMA zone of 50,450-50,400 will act as immediate support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 50,400 will lead to a sharp correction up to the recent swing low of 49,787 level, followed by 49,000 in the short term, while, on the upside, the resistance has shifted lower in the zone of 51,300-51,400 level in the short term. Do you expect General Insurance Corporation to extend its rally given the long horizontal resistance trendline breakout? Yes, it is likely to extend its northward journey as it has given a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout on a weekly scale. This breakout is confirmed by above 50-week average volume. As the stock is trading at an all-time high level, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum. However, the daily RSI, currently at 84.31, reflects an overbought condition, suggesting a potential short-term consolidation phase. Despite this, the overall trend remains positive, with the stock likely to continue its upward trajectory in the near term. As per the measure rule of a symmetrical triangle pattern, the upside target is placed at the Rs 595 level. On the downside, the zone of Rs 470-465 is likely to act as immediate support for the stock. After reading the chart structure, do you see Dr Reddy's Labs returning to record high by next week? While the stock is expected to revisit its record high, this is unlikely to happen by next week. Instead, we anticipate it will achieve this milestone within the next 2–3 weeks. Currently, the stock is trading within a Right-Angled Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern on the weekly chart. It recently rebounded sharply from the lower trendline of this pattern, supported by robust volumes. In the short term, the stock is likely to test the upper trendline of the wedge, which is presently around the Rs 1,500 level. Moreover, the weekly RSI has remained in a bullish zone since May 2022, as indicated by RSI range shift rules, reinforcing the positive momentum in the stock. Which are your 2 bullish bets for next week? KEC International The stock has marked the high of Rs 1,313 on December 4, and thereafter, it has witnessed a throwback. Interestingly, during the period of throwback, the volume activity was mostly below average, which indicates a routine decline after a sharp rebound. The throwback was halted near the 20-day EMA level, and it coincides with the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally. The stock has formed a strong base near the support zone and started rebounding along with the robust volume. The daily RSI is in a super bullish zone. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,240-1,230 level with a stop loss of Rs 1,195. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,300, followed by Rs 1,340 in the short term. Ipca Laboratories Recently, the stock has taken support near its 100-day EMA level and thereafter witnessed a sharp rebound along with robust volume. Further, it has surged above its short and long-term moving averages. Most noteworthy, the stock is strongly outperforming the frontline indices. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,580-1,590 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,535. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,670, followed by Rs 1,730 in the short term. Is it the time to stay away as well as exitSiemens? Yes, we recommend staying as well as exit from Siemens for the next couple of months. On a weekly scale, the stock has formed a Triple Top pattern, and it is about to slip below its neckline. Also, it has strongly underperformed the frontline indices for the last couple of months, and it is trading below its short and long-term moving averages. The momentum indicators and oscillators are also suggesting strong bearish momentum in the stock. What is your outlook for Nifty IT and Nifty Auto indices? The Nifty IT index has recently slipped below its 20-day EMA, which is a bearish sign. The momentum indicators and oscillators also suggest declining momentum. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover. In the Relative Rotation Graph (RRG), Nifty IT remains in the leading quadrant but has been declining over the past five sessions, indicating waning bullish momentum. Hence, we believe it is likely to witness consolidation with a bearish bias for the next couple of trading sessions. Nifty Auto has given a stage-4 cup pattern breakdown on a daily scale. It is also trading below its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in a falling mode. The daily RSI is in a bearish territory, and it is in a falling mode. Hence, we feel it is likely to continue its southward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.

Invest Now The broader indices remain under pressure throughout the week, losing between 3-5 percent and perform in line with the main indices, which posted biggest weekly fall in more than 2 years on global sell-off post Fed meet outcome. This week, BSE Sensex tumbled 4,091.53 points or 4.98 percent to close at 78,041.59, while the Nifty50 index plunged 1,180.8 points or 4.76 percent to finish at 23,587.50. All the sectoral indices ended in the red with BSE Power and Metal indices shed nearly 7 percent each, BSE Capital Goods index was down 6 percent, BSE Telecom index slipped 5.7 percent. During the week, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 15,828.11 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought equities worth Rs 11,873.92 crore. ""In the last week, the benchmark indices corrected sharply, with the Nifty ending 4.7 percent lower, while the Sensex was down by 4100 points. Among sectors, Metal and Bank Nifty indices corrected sharply, shed over 5 percent. During the week, the market slipped below the 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), and post-breakdown, selling pressure intensified,"" said Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities: ""Technically, the weekly charts have formed a long bearish candle, and after a long time, the Nifty closed below the 200-day SMA, which is largely negative. We believe that as long as the Nifty remains below the 200-day SMA or 23800/78300, weak sentiment is likely to continue. Below this level, the market could slip to 23400-23200/77500-77000."" ""On the other hand, if it rises above 23800/78300, the pullback formation is likely to continue up to 24000/80000. Further upside may also occur, potentially lifting the market up to 24200/80600,"" he added. The BSE Small-cap index was down 3 percent. Sanghi Industries, TARC, Sandur Manganese and Iron Ores, Jai Corp, Angel One, Deepak Fertilisers And Petrochemicals Corporation, MM Forgings, RPSG Ventures, Abans Holdings, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Industries, NIIT, Lincoln Pharmaceuticals, Texmaco Infrastructure & Holdings, Bajel Projects fell between 12-20 percent. On the other hand, Fairchem Organics, Tanfac Industries, Vakrangee, Five-Star Business Finance, Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers, Avalon Technologies, KFin Technologies, Zen Technologies, Chaman Lal Setia Exports, 63 Moons Technologies and Cosmo First rose between 14-48 percent.  Where is Nifty50 headed? Osho Krishnan, Sr. Analyst, Technical & Derivatives of - Angel One From a technical standpoint, as Nifty slipped below the pivotal zone of 200 SMA, the next potential support could be seen around the recent swing low around 23200-23100, while a decisive breach is likely to open further downside towards 22800 in the near period. The formation of a strong Bearish candle on the weekly chart certainly showcases a turnaround move, with bounces to be seen as opportunities to exit longs. As far as resistance is concerned, 23800-24000 is likely to be seen as an intermediate hurdle, followed by 24150-24300, coinciding with the bearish gap and the cluster of EMAs on the daily charts for the upcoming truncated week. The weak global cues initiated the downward move, but the follow-up sell-off showcases the bears' eagerness to color the market red ahead of Christmas. The advance declines have strongly turned to favor Bears, and it is advisable to avoid trying to catch the falling knife with anticipation of bottom-fishing. Considering the recent developments, it is advised to approach markets with proper risk management and refrain from taking complacent bets for the time being. Hrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Technically, Nifty initially found support near the 200-Days Simple Moving Average (200-DSMA) but owing to strong selling pressure, the index broke the support and formed a large red candle, indicating further weakness. The 200-DSMA is located near 23,830, which will serve as an immediate barrier for the index. On the downside, major support for the index is located near its previous swing low, which was around 23,260. As long as the index remains below 23,830, weakness will persist, suggesting a sell-on-bounce strategy. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services On Monday, markets will likely react to the US personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data for November, a key indicator for the Fed's future actions. Looking ahead, Indian markets are expected to remain subdued and will closely follow global cues amidst a volatile environment. With the festive season approaching and global markets closed for 2-3 days, including a domestic holiday on December 25, market activity is expected to be low next week.

Deploy ITM Spreads for expiry week trading: Shubham Agarwal,No date,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/deploy-itm-spreads-for-expiry-week-trading-shubham-agarwal-12894819.html,"My Account Follow us on: Powered By See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Powered By India's Largest Regional Retail Option Traders Summit.

Invest Now We are now in final expiry for 2024. Nifty is trading lower for the month. However, seasonal returns for the index have been positive. Looking at this many of us could get tempted to take a bargain-hunting trade in the final week of expiry. Since it is a low conviction and against the trend trade, one would for obvious reasons go for an option trade. However, trading options in normal weeks and the week of expiry are completely different things. There are 3 things that one has to take care of, which are the following. 1. Fast reducing Time Value2. Reducing the sensitivity of Higher Calls and Lower Puts (Cheaper to trade options).3. Inability to define a stop-loss in Option Premium All these 3 difficulties can be cleared by taking one simple trade in the week of Expiry. Trade: ITM Spread ITM: Lower Strike Calls and Higher Strike Puts compared to the current market price are called ITM Strikes. OTM: Higher Strike Calls and Lower Strike Puts compared to the current market price are called OTM Strikes. Spread: Spread is a strategy that involves the Buying and Selling of Options of the same stock. The Strike prices are usually different with the same Option type (Call or Put). In the ITM Spread strategy that we are referring to, one buys a one-step ITM Option and Sells a one-step OTM Option. Why Do This? Fast reducing time value negatively impacts an OTM but it positively impacts an ITM Option. Here by buying ITM and selling OTM, we are making a favourable use of the time value reduction characteristic of the Options. The second problem is also solved because the sensitivity of ITM Options is very high. On the other hand, the OTMs who are losing sensitivity to the move in the underlying stock/index are sold which benefits us. Lastly, since this is a spread one would not require keeping a stop loss. The maximum loss will be known at the beginning which is the net premium paid. Maximum profit will be the difference between the bought and sold strike minus the net premium paid. Now, we know the risk as well as the expected reward. This can help us decide whether to do the selected strikes or not. If the risk and max profit are not up to the mark, then one can change the strikes to bring it closer to the expectation. Example: RELIANCE @ 1218 (on 20th Dec). Assuming 3 days off, we check Bullish ITM Spread’s expected performance after 3 days on the day of expiry.  The chart shows ~9000 in max profit and ~6000 in max loss. This is 1.5:1 Max Profit: Max Loss. This may look a little disappointing on the face of it. However, no one takes stock options to expiry due to the physical delivery obligations. So, whoever does the trade and exits before the expiry even at a lower level of let’s say 1200 or 1190 also may not lose as big as 6000. The best way to trade expiry weeks is with OTM Spreads both bullish and bearish.

Invest Now US stocks rallied to close out the trading week on Friday after two lackluster sessions as a cooler-than-expected inflation report and comments from Federal Reserve officials eased worries about the path of interest rates. The latest inflation report in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index showed a 2.4% rise in November on an annual basis, just below the 2.5% estimate of economists polled by Reuters. Consumer spending increased in November in another sign of economic resilience. A line chart titled ""Annual change in US Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index"" that tracks the metric over the five years. In November the nationwide rate increased to 2.4% After the data, traders raised their slightly increased expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, now expecting the first one in March and another by October. Before the data, traders saw a roughly 50% chance of a second rate cut by December 2025. On Wednesday, the Fed announced its third interest-rate cut of the year but forecast in its summary of economic projections (SEP) just two 25-basis point cuts for 2025, down from its September view of four cuts, in a nod to the economy's continued health and sticky inflation. The announcement sparked a sharp sell-off late on Wednesday, which equities were unable to bounce back from on Thursday. Even with Friday's rally, each of the three major U.S. indexes declined for the week. Also providing support were comments from Fed officials, with some acknowledging they were starting to factor in fiscal policy uncertainty, such as tariffs, in their outlooks. ""It's kind of obvious what's going on - it's just this PCE plus dovish Fed commentary offset the market overreaction to the hawkish cut that everybody was expecting,"" said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors in New York. ""We've seen this like 10 times during this Fed cycle. The market just always overreacts on one side or the other."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 498.82 points, or 1.18%, to 42,841.06, the S&P 500 gained 63.82 points, or 1.09%, to 5,930.90 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 199.83 points, or 1.03%, to 19,572.60. The Dow and S&P recorded their biggest daily percentage gains since Nov. 6. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 1.99%, the Nasdaq declined 1.78%, and the Dow dropped 2.25%. The Nasdaq snapped a four-week streak of gains, with the S&P 500 suffering its biggest weekly percentage decline in six weeks. The Dow saw its third consecutive weekly fall. Each of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in the broad-based rally, led by a gain of 1.8% in real estate and buoyed by a drop in Treasury yields. Small-cap stocks as measured by the Russell 2000, which are also seen as likely to benefit from lower interest rates, rallied 0.9%. Markets were also monitoring the U.S. Congress as it scrambled to avert a partial government shutdown before a midnight deadline. Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives said they would vote on Friday to keep the federal government operating. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.84-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and 23 new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 233 new lows. Friday's session also marks the simultaneous expiry of quarterly derivatives contracts tied to stocks, index options and futures, also known as ""triple witching,"" which boosted trading activity. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 21.58 billion shares, compared with the 14.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Invest Now Dear Reader, The markets thought Jerome Powell was Santa, so naturally they were shocked when he turned out to be Scrooge. The Santa rally turned into a rout. It’s beginning to cost a lot like Christmas. A week or so ago the market believed the probability of the target Fed Funds rate being 400-425 basis points or higher by the end of 2025 was around 30 percent. Currently, at the time of writing, that had gone up to 53.3 percent. Putting it another way, after Powell’s presser on Wednesday, the markets think there’s a more than even chance that there’ll be just one more 25 basis point rate cut next year, quite a comedown from the two or three expected earlier. There were, of course, plenty of signs and portents. We had said“The Fed rate cut is almost a certainty this week, but next year is a different story.” We pointed out that US growth was strong, that inflation continued to be stubbornly above target and that there were innumerable signs of irrational exuberance, best seen from the sharp rises in meme coins such as Fartcoin (up 428 percent in the last one month), which for some reason seems to be a darling of commentators on X. As someone said, “It’s all fun and games till Santa checks the naughty list.” Many analysts had warned that the Fed had little option but to cut the policy rate this time, because of the overwhelming market expectation, while simultaneously talking tough. A “hawkish cut” was widely expected. Powell is being blamed for his flip-flops on monetary policy. He misled the markets into believing that he was a secret Santa by his 50 basis point rate cut in September and by his dovish tone in the November meet. If Powell is a Santa, he is a very schizophrenic one. Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queen’s College, Cambridge, thinks he’s a weathervane, buffeted by every gust of data. The clue to the market sell-off may lie in this month’s survey of global fund managers. Bank of America said it “shows super-bullish sentiment…record-low allocation to cash, record-high allocation to US stocks, 3-year high in global risk appetite…driven by 'Trump 2.0' US growth optimism & a compliant rate-cutting Fed.” The survey results were published just before the Fed decision and it argued that markets weretoo bullish for comfort. What’s most interesting is that it mentions growth optimism and rate cuts in the same breath---apparently the markets were gung-ho about strong US growth as well as rate cuts. Powell’s sudden about face accordingly led to much heartburn. Simply put, the markets expected not one but two Santas—Santa Trump and Santa Powell—and believe they would speed along at the end of the year powered by this double-engine. But while Trump continued to whip the reindeer ahead with promises of tax cuts and deregulation, Powell, spooked by the spectre of inflation brought on by Trump’s policies, suddenly pulled on the reins. The moral of the story is simple: you cannot have both a fiscal and a monetary Santa together. There can only be one Santa and he’s Donald Trump. The trouble is, this is an America First Santa, not bothered about children in the rest of the world, very different fromthis Santa. As my colleagueAnubhav Sahu pointed out, “In response to a shallow rate cut trajectory, the US 10-year yield has jumped to 4.5 percent and the dollar index is closer to 108.” A strong dollar is anathema to emerging markets andwe wrote that EM currencies are in for a poundingnext year. Asour columnist Ananya Roy said, in 2025 the Indian economy needs to show solid proof of being on the right track. Under these challenging circumstances, we have selected“The Dream Dozen: 12 Hot Themes to Rule 2025”to guide your investments. Indeed, the BofA survey had pointed out that while net allocations by fund managers to US markets were at record highs, Europe, emerging markets and UK markets bore the brunt of the outflows. As Ruchir Sharma wrote in his piece titled“How ‘the mother of all bubbles’ will pop”, “Virtually every Wall Street analyst predicts US stocks will continue outperforming the rest of the world in 2025. But all this enthusiasm only tends to confirm that the bubble is at a very advanced stage. If the consensus on “American exceptionalism” is so overwhelming, who is left to hop on the bandwagon and inflate it further?” Will the markets shrug off these qualms once again?As this FT story put it, “Do not overread the market’s reaction. Stock valuations are historically high and the bull market has been running for a long time.” With US GDP growth in Q3 at 3.1 percent, it’s not easy for bond yields to come down. Much depends on how long Donald Trump can play Surreal Santa for the markets.Katie Martin wrote, “Powell has done us all a favour by reminding investors that next year will not be for the faint of heart.” This might be the right time to remember what Herbert Hoover is supposed to have said: “A good many things go around in the dark besides Santa Claus.” Finally, for your listening pleasure, to get into the festive spirit, here’sMonty Python’s ‘Christmas in Heaven’’which contains these uplifting lines that many in the markets, till a short while ago, seemed to fervently believe: ‘’It's Christmas, it's Christmas in heaven Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray!

Invest Now Among the largecaps (value plays) one can invest in the stocks of private sector banks, media, pharma sectors for 2025, Jimeet Modi, CEO & Founder at Samco Group said in an interview to Moneycontrol. According to him, though FMCG stocks are down currently but are not out. They are expected to stabilize in next couple of quarters as they have already taken a huge hit and some of them are currently trading at fiver year lows, he said. However, he advised avoiding capital goods, railway and engineering sectors. ""Lot of capital goods sector companies are trading at a PE multiple of 100. Railway sector stocks also saw decent correction post July this year. Engineering sector stocks are trading at high PE multiples,' said the Chartered Accountant with more than 15 years of experience in equity research, investment analysis, and technology. Do you expect another 50 or 100-basis point cut in the Fed funds rate in 2025 after analysing the central bank's commentary from the December meeting? After the 100 basis points (bps) cut in the US interest rates in 2024 and the commentary that followed the last cut on December 18, the market is expecting rate cut of not more than 50 bps in 2025. However, it all depends on how the inflation in the US plays out going forward. The core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) index (exclusive of energy and food prices) has started to inch up and if that continues to rise, with the escalation of ongoing wars, which are unforeseeable, can fuel the inflation. In this scenario, the US Fed may be forced to maintain the status quo on the interest rate front. Do you anticipate the fundraising size (via IPOs, QIPs) in 2025 to exceed that of 2024? The primary market pipeline is directly related to subdued secondary market. Till the time secondary market remains subdued, going forward, the liquidity from this segment of market will find its way into the primary market as more and more paper is being floated. Recently concluded SME IPO of NACDAC Infrastructure’s Rs 10 crore issue received bids worth Rs 14,386 crore, almost 1,976 times of subscription. As the secondary market is subdued and volatile, investors are selling their holdings (shares) and investing those funds in the IPOs. This exuberance in primary market is expected to continue till the secondary market remains subdued but if there’s any major crash witnessed in the secondary market and if the listing gains vanishes, the primary market too may become unattractive to the investors. What is the best approach for asset allocation in 2025? The market performance in 2025 is mostly expected to be more or less replica of 2024. In this scenario, for retail investors, it will be more prudent to preserve their capital rather than focus on return on investment. In this backdrop, we advise them to deploy 50% of their funds in largecap stocks, 25% in Gold and 25% in debt, in order to diversify their portfolio in 2025. Among the largecaps (value plays) one can invest in the stocks of Private sector Bank, Media, Pharma sectors. Though FMCG stocks are down currently but are not out. They are expected to stabilize in next couple of quarters as they have already taken a huge hit and some of them are currently trading at fiver year lows. What is your take on the current year? Do you expect 2025 to be a better year for equity markets than 2024? The India story remains strong in the medium to long run. Having said that, the performance of Indian equity market in 2024 was more closely linked to global markets and liquidity flows from the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Domestic liquidity also played equally important role but foreign flows and developments impact the market sentiment more than anything else. Developments in the US markets, inflation, fears of recession and developments on the US interest rate front weighed on the Indian markets in 2024 and it will continue to have its impact in 2025 too. Indian markets were volatile but did not see major collapse in 2024 but looking at what is in store in 2025, it will not be majorly different from what we have seen this year. Which sectors should be ignored in 2025? Lot of capital goods sector companies are trading at a PE multiple of 100. Railway sector stocks also saw decent correction post July this year. Engineering sector stocks are trading at high PE multiples. One can avoid trading in these sector stocks. So, the investing theme should be defensive, don’t be aggressive and also remain selective. Even if market remains sideways and it does not fall as anticipated, the select defensive sectors will continue to perform. Also, one should avoid aggressively priced IPOs. If you are lucky enough to get the allotment, pocket the listing gains and exit, otherwise you may get stuck in the investment as its fate is linked to the performance of the secondary market going ahead. What are your expectations for the December quarter earnings season? The earning number of Q3 ending December 2024 will not be significantly differ from that of the second quarter. Major sectors are facing the demand slow down. Automobile sector is seeing inventory pile up. FMCG is down, capital goods is slowly moving up with the resumption of government capex, however, its impact will be seen in the its performance in the Q4 FY25.

Invest Now With strong domestic flows, structural reforms, and demographic advantages, India remains well-positioned for growth, according to Neelesh Surana, CIO, Mirae Asset Managers (India). He was speaking as a part of Mirae Asset Manager’s 2024- 2025 review. ""Last year was phenomenal; in fact, the last two years have been exceptional, with broader market returns of 14–15% and mid-cap and small-cap returns doubling,"" Surana noted. On concerns about valuations in these segments, he added: ""There’s a general perception that mid and small caps are expensive. Our house view is different. We think the basket has expanded significantly, making it possible to construct a robust mid- and small-cap portfolio. It’s not about making direct comparisons; it’s about recognizing the opportunities within these segments."" The broader market performance, according to Surana, has continued to be strong with the Nifty delivering positive returns for the 8th or 9th consecutive year. On global trends, Surana noted that the “noise” from global themes will continue in 2025. He added that there are two transformative trends: the diversification of supply chains through the ""China Plus One"" strategy and changes in the monetary ecosystem. ""The geopolitical shift benefits India, while the US, historically a lender, is now a borrower, facing a 6 percent fiscal deficit and a 4 percent current account deficit. These factors introduce challenges but also create relative advantages for India,"" he said. Surana remains optimistic on India. On the domestic front, he noted that the challenges were cyclical such as elections, weather, and monetary policy and not structural. Monetary constraints, he noted have also impacted growth, but relief could be on the horizon. ""We anticipate at least one interest rate cut in 2025, alongside a CRR cut, which will improve system liquidity,"" he said. Over the medium term, he expects India’s GDP growth to stabilise at 6.5–7%. ""Macroeconomic indicators like fiscal and current account deficits are in reasonable shape, and India’s relative positioning remains strong,"" he added.. Looking ahead, earnings growth is projected to recover with a 14–15 percent CAGR by FY26. ""Valuations, at around 20x FY26 earnings, remain reasonable, supported by long-term growth prospects and a lower cost of capital,"" he said. On earnings growth slowdown over the last two quarters, Surana suggests that growth was impacted by elections, weather and monetary policy. But added that these changes were not structural and could see improvement in 2025. Domestic flows remain strong Surana also noted that domestic market flows remain strong, with nearly Rs 5 lakh crore inflows from mutual funds, insurance, and other institutions in 2023. IPOs and rights issues also contributed to the space. The outlook for the equity market is positive. ""Returns of 10–15% over a 3–5 year horizon are realistic,"" he said adding that SIPs remain the best approach for long-term wealth creation. Long-Term Market Drivers In the long-term, Surana noted that there are three key drivers of India’s economic growth – consumption, Investment and exports. ""India’s transition to a middle-income economy, with increasing per capita income, is a testament to the reforms implemented over the last decade,"" he noted. On themes to watch out for in 2025, Surana suggested that there could be opportunities in Banking, Manufacturing and Mass Consumption.

Invest Now The largest cryptocurrencyBitcoinfell sharply on December 20, amid broader investor caution toward risk assets post-hawkish tilt by the US Federal Reserve earlier this week. Bitcoin traded at around $92,292.07 at 6 pm IST, down over 9% from 24 hours before where it was priced above $102,000. Bitcoin hit an all-time high at $108,309 just this week, but has since sold off aggressively. The US Fed rattled markets in recent days as it signaled fewer rate cuts next year. Equity markets took a hit, filtering through to crypto assets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank has no desire to be involved in any government effort to stockpile large amounts of bitcoin. ""We're not allowed to own bitcoin,"" Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, in which policymakers cut rates as expected while signaling a less certain path for monetary policy in the months ahead. Trump has suggested he will create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve- a concept that has also been widely rejected in Europe. Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to more than $100,000 on optimism over Trump's pro-crypto stance. The asset has proven volatile in its 15 years of existence, which analysts say reduces its utility as a store of value or a unit of exchange, key attributes of a reserve currency. The incoming president has not provided details on what such a reserve would entail, beyond saying its initial holdings could include bitcoin seized from criminals, a stockpile of about 200,000 tokens worth about $21 billion at current prices.

Invest Now The number of days that Asset Management Companies (AMCs) have to make their Draft Scheme Information Documents (SIDs) available for public comments has been reduced to nearly a third. They have to do so only now for eight working days versus the earlier 21 working days. In a circular titled ""Simplification of Offer Document"" issued on December 20, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) stated that SIDs on which the regulator's observations have been issued need to be uploaded for public comments only for eight days. The previous directions had required AMCs to submit soft copy of the Draft SIDs with SEBI to be made available on SEBI’s website for 21 working days from the date of filing for receiving the public comment on the adequacy of disclosures made in the document. Also read:MC Investigates| Epic Traders: Two entities, same name, same scam According to the regulator, the structure and content of the documents have been standardised. Its format was revised in November 2023 to streamline the dissemination of relevant information to investors, rationalise the preparation of SID and facilitate its periodic updation. Therefore the requirement of uploading it so many days prior to the final document, for public comments, was reviewed. Based on this exercise and public consultation, the regulator has decided that the SID on which observations are issued by SEBI need to be uploaded on the regulator website only for eight working days for receiving public comments on the adequacy of disclosures made in the document. Therefore Clause 1.1.3.1.a. of the Master Circular on Mutual Funds dated June 27,2024, stands modified as under:“Draft SID on which SEBI observation letter has been issued shall be made available on SEBI’s website – http:// www.sebi.gov.in for at least 8 working days for receiving public comments on the adequacy of disclosures made in the document after which AMC may launch the scheme and file final offer documents (SID and KIM) in line with the provisions of clause 1.1.3.3 of SEBI Master Circular on Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024. Validity of SEBI observation on SID will be in accordance with clause 1.3 of Master Circular on Mutual Funds dated June 27, 2024."" Discover the latestbusiness news,Sensex, andNiftyupdates.
